A mobile application that finds nearby restaurants

AS A hungry person
I WANT to find all available nearby restaurants
SO THAT I can choose where I'm going to buy lunch

A reminder app that keeps track of important tasks

AS A person who takes prescription meds at certain times
I WANT to get an alert when I need to take my meds
SO THAT I don't miss my doses

Ideas:
- things to do safely during quarantine
- things to watch on Netflix
- next book to read
- dogs available for adoption in local area
- dog behavioralists; correcting behaviors
- planning a vacation: budget, weather
